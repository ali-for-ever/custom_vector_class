# Vector Implementation in C++

A custom `Vector` container implementation that mimics `std::vector`, built from scratch in 4 days.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned in 4 Days

**Day 1**: Basic template syntax, dynamic memory allocation, and initial push_back implementation

**Day 2**: Rule of Five - copy/move constructors, assignment operators, and exception safety

**Day 3**: Modern C++ features - constexpr, noexcept, perfect forwarding, and iterators

**Day 4**: Advanced memory management, type deduction, and custom algorithms

## ðŸ”§ Key Challenges Overcome

- **Exception-safe reallocation** using `std::move_if_noexcept`
- **Proper move semantics** implementation without resource leaks
- **Template type deduction** in transformation functions
- **Memory management** across copy/move operations
- **STL-compatible interface** with iterator support

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented

- Dynamic array with automatic reallocation
- Rule of Five compliance
- Exception-safe operations
- Modern C++ features (constexpr, noexcept, perfect forwarding)
- STL-compatible iterators and methods
- Custom transform and sum functions with type deduction

*Built from scratch in 4 days, demonstrating rapid learning of advanced C++ concepts*
